/*
The 
sendfile
call can be used in many places to make copies more efficient. One
good example is in a Web server or other network daemon, that serves the contents of
a file over the network to a client program.Typically, a request is received from a
socket connected to the client computer.The server program opens a local disk file to
etrieve the data to serve and writes the fileâ€™s contents to the network socket. Using
sendfile can speed up this operation considerably. Other steps need to be taken to
make the network transfer as efficient as possible, such as setting the socket parameters
correctly. However, these are outside the scope of this book.
